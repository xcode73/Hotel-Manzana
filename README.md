Your client at Hotel Manzana has given you a list of the information they'd like to collect: 
- the guest's first name 
- last name
- email
- the check-in and check-out dates
- the number of adults and children in the room
- whether the guest wants Wi-Fi access
- and the guest's room choice 

Hotel Manzana has three different room choices: 
- a room with two queen beds
- a room with one king bed
- and a suite with two king bedrooms. 

Each room type has a name, a short name (fewer than three characters), and a price. 
Also include an ID number in your data model—invisible to the user—to make it easy to check whether two room type instances are equal.
